# About Me

Hello! I am Tousif Ahmed, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington, working with Professor Apu Kapadia. Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my undergraduate from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).

My research interests span various topics in usable security and privacy including inclusive privacy and security,  security and privacy of wearable devices, and social media privacy.  As a researcher, I prefer to make impactful contributions to the real world through my research. I want to address various security and privacy issues using Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Computer Vision. My research investigates the ways to privacy and security issues of people with visual impairments using wearable cameras.
